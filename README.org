#+title: Arian's Goofy Agents
#+startup: fold

Experimental little agents to make my existence obsolete.


* Scratchpad
** Requirements
While not strict, here are a few broad guidelines to adhere when creating
things:
- Containerization :: Try to make it work on all machines that can run
  Linux OCI containers.
- Pipeability :: Make these work in a standard posix shell or nushell pipelines.
- Self-containment :: Shebangmaxx. =env -S= isn't posix, and neither
  is anything written here.
** Ideas
- Abstract away agent classes so that it's easy to make custom ones
- Make a big ahh collection of MCPs, and possibly custom tooling like
  - HTTP calls
  - REPL access to niche languages
- Pre-commit
- Publish a ghcr container(s) once things start to look up
** Agent ideas
*** TODO The differ
This is a coding agent that does not change any files. Here's how it
works:
1. The agent (containerized, maybe even sub-containerized) has
   readonly access to some mounted volume from the host.
2. The agent makes a hard clone of the directory elsewhere (think
   =mktemp=)
3. The agent dynamically decides what MCPs to use. Since MCPs are
   context-hungry and resource-intensive, they'd have to be
   cherrypicked based on the situation (i.e. you'd wanna hook into
   playwright for a webapp, but you wouldn't need it for a C project).
4. The agent reasons and acts accordingly, making changes to the clone
   as needed.
5. Once it is deemed ready, the agent creates a =diff= (not git diff)
   and prints it to the stdout.
**** Cons
- Oneshot
- Filters zoomers who can't live without a bloated JSslop forge

** Requirements
While not strict, here are a few broad guidelines to adhere when creating
things:
- Containerization :: Try to make it work on all machines that can run

- Pipeability :: Make these work in a standard posix shell or nushell pipelines.
- Self-containment :: Shebangmaxx. =env -S= isn't posix, and neither
  is anything written here.
